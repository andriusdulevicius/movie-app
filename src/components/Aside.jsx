          So I wanted to share a short thing, To fill content as a developer we kind of rely on lorem ipsum, hipsum etc.
          Though a few weeks ago I found an amazing site Trumpsum Yes, that’s right it’s Lorem Ipsum written like the
          way Trump talks and it’s amazing, so I figured I post a little below so you can read and see. Remember its
          dummy text but god is it funny and good. Below are 15 paragraphs created in Trumpsum enjoy it. I write the
          best placeholder text, and I’m the biggest developer on the web by far… While that’s mock-ups and this is
          politics, are they really so different? We have so many things that we have to do better… and certainly, ipsum
          is one of them. I have a 10-year-old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it’s unbelievable.
          Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. My text is long
          and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. I know words. I have
          the best words. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t
          captured. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text… It’s an art you’re basically born with.
